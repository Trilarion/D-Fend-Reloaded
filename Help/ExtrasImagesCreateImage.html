<h1>Create image file</h1>

<p>
In this dialog you can create new, empty floppy disk and hard disk images.
This images can be mounted as drives inside DOSBox via the
<a href="ProfileEditDrives.html">drives</a> page of the
<a href="ProfileEdit.html">profile editor</a>.
</p>

<h3>Floppy image</h3>

<p>
From this dialog page you can create every possible floppy disk image type.
From the "Disk type" dropdown box you can select the most common disk types.
The disk images will be formated and ready to use inside DOSBox.
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Compress image in NTFS file system</b><br />
  If this option is activated, the image file will be stored as
  a compressed file. This means the file will only use the amount of
  disk space it really needs to store the files inside it and not
  for every empty sector. The compression will be done by the
  Windows disk drivers so use can handle this file like a normal
  file without needing to use a (de-)compression program.
  </li>
  <li><b>Make floppy image bootable</b><br />
  If this option is activated, D-Fend Reloaded will transfer the
  FreeDOS boot files to the floppy image and will create a
  bootsector for making it bootable. (For using this option
  you will need to have FreeDOS installed. You can configurate
  the path a you FreeDOS installation on the
  <a href="FileOptionsFreeDOS.html">FreeDOS</a> page of
  the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog.)
  </li>
  <li><b>Use DOSBox default keyboard layout on bootdisk</b><br />
  If this option is activated, D-Fend Reloaded will also transfer
  the keyboard driver to the bootdisk and will add a line to the
  <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> file of the bootdisk to activate the
  keyboard layout which is defined as default for the current
  D-Fend Reloaded program language.
  </li>
  <li><b>Include mouse driver on bootdisk</b><br />
  If this option is activated, D-Fend Reloaded will transfer
  the mouse driver to the bootdisk and will add a line to the
  <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> file of the bootdisk to activate it.
  </li>  
</ul>

<h3>Hard disk image</h3>

<p>
From this dialog page you can create hard disk images of any size.
D-Fend Reloaded will choose the right drive geometry automatically for you.
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li><b>Compress image in NTFS file system</b><br />
  If this option is activated, the image file will be stored as
  a compressed file. This means the file will only use the amount of
  disk space it really needs to store the files inside it and not
  for every empty sector. The compression will be done by the
  Windows disk drivers so use can handle this file like a normal
  file without needing to use a (de-)compression program.
  </li>
  <li><b>Image type</b><br />
  Because preformated hard disk images cannot be made bootable
  inside DOSBox you can choose to create a plain, unformated
  hard disk image. In this case you will need to boot from
  a bootable floppy disk and create a partition on the hard disk
  using fdisk. (See also the <a href="FAQ.html#FAQ10">FAQ</a> for
  a description how to create bootable hard disk images.)
  </li>
</ul>
