<h1>First run wizard</h1>

<p>
The first run wizard will help you to initially setup D-Fend Reloaded.
It consists of 5 page; you can change between the pages by pressing the
"Previous" and "Next" buttons. By pressing the "Accept all settings" button
you can immediately close the dialog and accept all settings without
checking them.
</p>

<p>
You can change all settings later at any time via the
<a href="FileOptions.html">program options</a> dialog.
</p>

<h2>Page 1: Program language</h2>

<p>
On this page you can select the language you want to use in the program.
Initally the language you have chosen in the installer will be selected on this page.
Changing the program language will take effect immediately.
</p>

<h2>Page 2: DOSBox folder</h2>

<p>
DOSBox is needed to run the games configurated in D-Fend Reloaded.
If DOSBox has been installed together with D-Fend Reloaded the right path
should already be shown on this page. Additionally D-Fend Reloaded will
try to find any existing DOSBox installation if it was not installed
together with DOSBox.
</p>

<p>
If you have installed D-Fend Reloaded in portable mode the DOSBox path
needs to be stored relatively to the program path. The path shown in this
dialog will be an absolute path but nevertheless it will be stored
to as a relative path. So there is no cause to worry about this.
</p>

<h2>Page 3: DOSBox language</h2>

<p>
On this page you can choose the language DOSBox should use when
showing messages. D-Fend Reloaded will offer you all language files
available in the DOSBox folder defined on the last page.
</p>

<h2>Page 4: Games folder</h2>

<p>
You can place the games you want to use with D-Fend Reloaded in any folder
you want to but if you choose a subfolder of the base folder (something
like <tt>C:\Users\<i>YourAccount</i>\D-Fend Reloaded</tt>), you will
be able to <a href="ExtrasTransferProfiles.html">transfer profiles</a>
from one installation to another and to
<a href="ExtrasBuildInstallers.html">build installer packages</a> from
the installed games.
</p>

<p>
In most cases you just should keep the offered default games folder.
</p>

<h2>Page 5: Updates</h2>

<p>
On this last page you can choose if D-Fend Reloaded should look for updates
automatically. If you keep to default setting on this page it will never
connect to the internet automatically. You can look for update manually
at any time via the <a href="HelpSearchForUpdates.html">search for updates</a>
function from the help menu.
</p>

<p>
The automatic update search will not transfer any of your private data
to the internet. It will just check if a special update info file will
contain a bigger version number than the number of the current installed
version and will offer in case to download the update installer for the
new version. (For more information about the update checker see
the <a href="FileOptionsSearchForUpdates.html">search for updates</a> page of
the <a href="FileOptions.html">program options dialog</a>.)
