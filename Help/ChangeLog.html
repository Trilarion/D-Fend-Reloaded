    and zip file pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can make zip packages from installed games (just like the exe installers)
    for long time archiving your games. The zip archive will contain all game
    data (prof file, game files, icon, captured images/sound/videos, additional
    data files). And of course you can import games stored in a zip package to
    D-Fend Reloaded agian. (They can be installed via the File|Import menu or

    The benefit of this function is you can manage all your games in one GUI.)
  </li>
  <li>
    For each profile you can configurate to use another DOSBox language than the

    search engines from the profile editor, the "Profile" menu and the context
    menu of a profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    D-Fend Reloaded can store additionally to the program and the setup file
    other program files (for example a level editor) which are offered to start
    via the context menu of the profile and the profile menu.

  <li>    
    Now screenshots taken by ScummVM can also be managed within D-Fend Reloaded.

  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] When using long folder names inside a DOSBox drive D-Fend Reloaded may

<div id="ver040">
<ul>
  <li>
    Simplified Chinese language file (thanks to muzuiget)
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    ScummVM based advantures can be configurated and listed together with the
    DOSBox based profiles now.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you define a QBasic interpreter in the setup dialog, you can define bas
    files as normal program files for games. When executing a bas file profile

    much easier.

  </li>
  <li>

    icons (and can be transfered with the profile and included to installers just
    like the icons in the default icons folder).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you delete a profile file while D-Fend Reloaded is running it will ask you
    if you want to restore the deleted file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can setup a codepage to be used in DOSBox for each profile. 
    Additionally there is a default codepage stored in each language file which
    will be used if the codepage is set to "default" in the profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can (optionally) define a key mapper file for each profile. (If no
    key mapper file is defined, the DOSBox default key mapper file will be used.)
  </li>
  <li>
    A list of batch commands which DOSBox will run after the end of the game can
    be defined now (some kind of complement of the Autoexec.bat commands).

    configuration) in the destination folder before copying the profile data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can define if the path to the game and the setup exe file should be
    interpreted absolute (in the physical file system) or relative (to the file
    system in DOSBox).
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can configurate in the setup dialog if D-Fend Reloaded should show
    configuration options in the profile editor which can only be used with
    DOSBox CVS builds (like multiple floppy images per drive, PhysFS support,
    setting the number of text mode lines, VGA chipset and video RAM, Glide
    emulation and printer support).
  </li>
  <li>
    When changeing multiple profiles, creating installers etc. now you can select
    and unselect profiles also by any user defined information. (Until now
    selecting was only possible by the predefined fields like language,
    developer, year, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>

    The profile editor will show a warning if the user trys to create a new
    profile with no game program filename (and is not using a boot image option).

  <li>
    When opening the select game exe or select setup exe dialog from the profile
    editor or the wizard the path of the setup exe or the game exe (if already
    defined) will be used as initial directory instead of the games base
    directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a checksum error (changed or exchanged game program file) is detected,
    D-Fend Reloaded now also offers the option to turn off checksums for the
    profile (until now only keep old checksum or create new checksum).
  </li>
  <li>
    The checksum driven game file change detection can be turned off in the setup
    dialog now.

    encoded to mp3 or ogg directly from the dialog now.

    Some new icons in the modern and classic profile editor (thanks to Banjo).
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] Even if you choose "Restore profile on disk with version from memory"
    when a file conflict occures the profile on disk will not be changed and
    the version in memory will be lost as long as you do not make any changes to
    the profile in memory before closing D-Fend Reloaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] The boot from floppy image function did not work if you used a single
    image file.
