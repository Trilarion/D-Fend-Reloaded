<h1>Program options dialog page "DOSBox"</h1>

<p>
On this page you can configurate the DOSBox versions to use with D-Fend Reloaded.
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>DOSBox installation</b><br>
    D-Fend Reloaded can manage multiple DOSBox installations. From this dropdown box you can choose which
    installation you want to configurare. You can add and delete as many installations as you want to,
    but on installation - called "Default" - is marked as undeleteable. You can choose for each profile 
    from the <a href="ProfileEdit.html">profile editor</a> which DOSBox installation to use.
    <br />(Default value for this option: "Default")
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DOSBox folder</b><br />
    In this edit field you can enter the path of the DOSBox installation you want to use.<br /><br />
    In portable mode this directory is stored relatively to the program folder <b>at program end</b>.
    When D-Fend Reloaded is started again it <b>will make absolute paths for the three directories again</b>.
    So this directory is shown here with absolute paths in any operation mode.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The following settings will only be visible if the advanced setup mode is selected at the bottom of the program options dialog:
</p>

<ul class="big">
  <li>
    <b>More settings for this DOSBox installation</b><br />
    Clicking on this button will open a dialog with some extra settings for the selected DOSBox installation.
    (See section "More settings for this DOSBox installation" at the bottom of this page.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Minimize D-Fend Reloaded when DOSBox starts</b><br />
    If this option is activated, the D-Fend Reloaded main window will minimize
    as soon as you start a DOSBox based profile.
    <br />(Default value for this option: off)
  </li>  
  <li>
    <b>Restore program window when DOSBox is closed</b><br />
    This option can only be activated if "Minimize D-Fend Reloaded when DOSBox starts" is active.
    It will restore the D-Fend Reloaded main window as soon as the DOSBox instance you have
    started by starting some profile closes.
    <br />(Default value for this option: off)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Use short path names for mount commands</b><br />
    The DOSBox command line is limited to 134 characters, so long path names in
    mount commands can cause problems. With this option activated D-Fend Reloaded
    will create short path names in the DOSBox conf file
    ("PROGRA~1" instead of "Program files" for example) to keep the commands
    for mounting folders short.
    <br />(Default value for this option: on)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Show warning messages on DOSBox path name translation errors</b><br />
    Because DOSBox uses a different algorithm to make short path names than Windows,
	long path names need to be translated to the DOSBox version (for example for use in "cd" commands).
	If this option is activated you will get a warning message if this translation process fails.
    <br />(Default value for this option: on)
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Always create conf files for all profiles</b><br />
	If this option is turned on, D-Fend Reloaded will create for each profile file (*.prof) a DOSBox
	configuration file (*.conf) in the "Confs" folder and keep this configuration file up to date.
	If this option is off, the DOSBox configuration files will only be generated on the fly when
	starting DOSBox. (The function to always create all configuration files is not available in
	portable operation mode.)
	<br />(Default value for this option: off)
</ul>
