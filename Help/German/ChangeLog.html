    and zip file pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can make zip packages from installed games (just like the exe installers)
    for long time archiving your games. The zip archive will contain all game
    data (prof file, game files, icon, captured images/sound/videos, additional
    data files). And of course you can import games stored in a zip package to
    D-Fend Reloaded agian. (They can be installed via the File|Import menu or

    search engines from the profile editor, the "Profile" menu and the context
    menu of a profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    D-Fend Reloaded can store additionally to the program and the setup file
    other program files (for example a level editor) which are offered to start
    via the context menu of the profile and the profile menu.

  </li>
  <li>
    D-Fend Reloaded will warn you, if you try to setup a Windows exe file to run
    in DOSBox.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can setup if the DOSBox console should stay open when an error in
    DOSBox occures.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can choose to temporary disable the screensaver when DOSBox is running.
  </li>

  <li>
    You can change the font style (bold, italic, underline) for displaying the
    favorites now.
  </li>
  <li>
    The view conf file option will use the default txt editor instead of always
    using notepad.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some more speed improvements when working with large profile lists.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] The "Run setup" toolbar button was not working.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] Creation of 2880KB ("extended density") floppy images failed.
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] When using long folder names inside a DOSBox drive D-Fend Reloaded may
    tryed to start files in the wrong folder because Windows and DOSBox used
    different ways of translating long to short file names.

<div id="ver040">
<ul>
  <li>
    Simplified Chinese language file (thanks to muzuiget)
  </li>
  <li>
    The new profile wizard has been completely redesigned. With the new auto
    setup templates new profiles (for games known by the D-Fend Reloaded
    database) can be setup by only entering the game name and the filename.
  </li>
  <li>
    ScummVM based advantures can be configurated and listed together with the
    DOSBox based profiles now.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you define a QBasic interpreter in the setup dialog, you can define bas
    files as normal program files for games. When executing a bas file profile
    D-Fend Reloaded will automatically execute it in QBasic in DOSBox.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new first run wizard makes setting up language and updates for new users
    much easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    The content of image files can be extracted to a folder now.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can build a floppy image from the content of a folder now.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you copy prof files to the "Confs" folder while D-Fend Reloaded is running
    they will be added to the games list immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Icons form outside the "IconLibrary" folder can now also be used as profile
    icons (and can be transfered with the profile and included to installers just
    like the icons in the default icons folder).
  </li>
  <li>
    If you delete a profile file while D-Fend Reloaded is running it will ask you
    if you want to restore the deleted file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can setup a codepage to be used in DOSBox for each profile. 
    Additionally there is a default codepage stored in each language file which
    will be used if the codepage is set to "default" in the profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can (optionally) define a key mapper file for each profile. (If no
    key mapper file is defined, the DOSBox default key mapper file will be used.)
  </li>
  <li>
    A list of batch commands which DOSBox will run after the end of the game can
    be defined now (some kind of complement of the Autoexec.bat commands).
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can also make installer packages from your profile templates.
  </li>
  <li>
    The templates dialog now has an option to change multiple templates at once
    (like the multi profile editor for normal profile).

    More option to configurate low-level access to mounted CDROMs.
  </li>
  <li>
    When creating floppy images you can choose to make the image bootable now.

    The tray icon has a context menu for direct starting and adding of profiles.
  </li>
  <li>
    The transfer profiles function can create a portable version of D-Fend
    Reloaded (by copying files from the current installation and modifing the
    configuration) in the destination folder before copying the profile data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can define if the path to the game and the setup exe file should be
    interpreted absolute (in the physical file system) or relative (to the file
    system in DOSBox).
  </li>
  <li>
    Now you can configurate in the setup dialog if D-Fend Reloaded should show
    configuration options in the profile editor which can only be used with
    DOSBox CVS builds (like multiple floppy images per drive, PhysFS support,
    setting the number of text mode lines, VGA chipset and video RAM, Glide
    emulation and printer support).
  </li>
  <li>
    When changeing multiple profiles, creating installers etc. now you can select
    and unselect profiles also by any user defined information. (Until now
    selecting was only possible by the predefined fields like language,
    developer, year, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Profiles (conf and prof files), screenshots and captured sound can be
    imported by drag&drop now. Dragging program files to the D-Fend Reloaded
    program window will open the new profile wizard with the chosen file.

    information fields now.

    files (like it is already possible with the extra directories).
  </li>
  <li>
    The profile editor will show a warning if the user trys to create a new
    profile with no game program filename (and is not using a boot image option).
  </li>
  <li>
    When opening the select game exe or select setup exe dialog from the profile
    editor or the wizard the path of the setup exe or the game exe (if already
    defined) will be used as initial directory instead of the games base
    directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    When a checksum error (changed or exchanged game program file) is detected,
    D-Fend Reloaded now also offers the option to turn off checksums for the
    profile (until now only keep old checksum or create new checksum).
  </li>
  <li>
    The checksum driven game file change detection can be turned off in the setup
    dialog now.
  </li>
  <li>
    The mount dialog will show a warning if the users trys to use the same drive
    letter for two mounted drives.

    to any position in the file via a slider and the captured wave sound can be
    encoded to mp3 or ogg directly from the dialog now.
  </li>
  <li>
    The screenshot view dialog has been improved: You can cycle though the
    screenshots of a profile via two new toolbar buttons (or by using the cursor
    keys or the mouse wheel) without closing the dialog. Additionally the zoom
    level is set to 100% when a new image is loaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    The import conf file function now trys to make mount records from the mount
    commands of the autoexec section.
  </li>

    each profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some new icons in the modern and classic profile editor (thanks to Banjo).
  </li>
  <li>
    [Fix] Even if you choose "Restore profile on disk with version from memory"
    when a file conflict occures the profile on disk will not be changed and
    the version in memory will be lost as long as you do not make any changes to
    the profile in memory before closing D-Fend Reloaded.
  </li>
