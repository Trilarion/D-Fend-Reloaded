Answers:

1.) How does the update checker operates ?

The update checker is reading this file from Sourceforge:
"http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/UpdateInfo.txt" The file contains two
lines; in the first line the version number of the current D-Fend Reloaded
version on the server is given ("0.3.0" for example) and in the second line
the download URL of the update installer for this version is given
("http://downloads.sourceforge.net/dfendreloaded/D-Fend-Reloaded-0.3.0-UpdateSetup.exe"
for example). If the version number in the UpdateInfo.txt is bigger than the
version number of the currently installed D-Fend Reloaded version, the update
checker will ask you, if you want to update to the new version. If you say
"yes", it will download the file from the second line of the UpdateInfo.txt to
your temporary directory and will launch it. As the last step it tells Windows
to delete this file as soon as possible. Because the installer is just running,
Windows cannot delete the file and will put it on its "delete on next system
start" list.

At the moment the UpdateInfo.txt is a static file, but in the future there
could be version depending updates (smaller file to bring you from 0.4.0 to
0.4.1 and a bigger file to bring you from 0.3.0 to 0.4.1). Therefore D-Fend
Reloaded is adding a "?Version=0.3.0" (or whatever the current version is) to
the request URL. If you do not want the php script on Sourceforge to know
your current D-Fend Reloaded version, you can add the line
"VersionSpecificUpdateCheck=0" to the [ProgramSets] section of the "DFend.ini"
(which can be found in the D-Fend Reloaded data directory). There is not
privacy risk in sending the current version number because php scripts on
Sourceforge are not allowed to write anything to a file and therefor cannot
log any request. 

The update checker does nothing else you would do when you look for updates.
The update checker can automatically check for updates when D-Fend Reloaded
is started. But because many people do not like applications "phoning home"
without their permission, this feature is turned off by default. (You can turn
it on in the category "service" in the setup dialog. And you can manually start
the update checker at any time by choosing "Check for updates..." from the
"Help" menu.)

The update checker will use the windows connection settings (which you can edit
in the Internet Explorer). This means: If you have setup a proxy server in the
Internet Explorer, the D-Fend Reloaded update checker will use this proxy, too.



2.) I get an "DFend.dat not found" error when running a self made installer
    package.

The self made installer packages do not include D-Fend Reloaded or DOSBox. This
means you have to install D-Fend Reloaded on the computer before you can use
an installer package.

If you have installed D-Fend Reloaded in "user directory" mode (the default
installation type), the target directory is still the D-Fend Reloaded program
folder ("C:\Program Files\D-Fend Reloaded" for example) and not the data
directory (something like "C:\Users\you\D-Fend Reloaded"). The data package
installer will only read from this directory and only copy files to the
data directory, so it can run without admin rights under Vista.

If you want to have an all inclusive package, install D-Fend Reloaded in
portable mode to a directory, install or transfer the games to this installation
and then make a zip archive of this directory or simply copy the whole folder
to an USB stick. So you can show your games to others without any installation.



3.) I know exactly which setting is on which tab in the D-Fend profile editor
    dialog. Where is this dialog gone in D-Fend Reloaded ?
	
D-Fend Reloaded has two profile editor dialogs integrated: The classical D-Fend
style profile editor and the modern profile editor. Both dialogs offer all 
available settings, so there is no need two choose one of them to be able to
access all features. Which profile editor should be used can be configured in
the setup dialog in the category "profile editor". This category will only be
visible, if you choose "Advanced" as mode in the dialog.



4.) I am using a special DOSBox build with some more features. Does D-Fend
    Reloaded support some of this features ?

These special builds often have more scalers or render methods. The values
which D-Fend Reloaded offers in its profile editors for this settings can be
configured in the setup dialog in the category "Default values". This
category will only be visible, if you choose "Advanced" as mode in the dialog.

Some builds support the mounting of multiple floppy images for one drive
(like the normal build offers for CDROM images). Because the "imgmount" command
of the official DOSBox version can not handle multiple floppy images for one
drive and will show an error message and not mount anything at all, D-Fend
Reloaded offers no option to mount multiple floppy images for one drive to
avoid errors. (For booting from a floppy images via the "boot" command
DOSBox supports multiple images and so does D-Fend Reloaded.) But D-Fend
Reloaded has a build-in but by default disabled option for mounting multiple
floppy images for one drive. For activating this option you have to add in
the [ProgramSets] section of the "DFend.ini" (which can be found in the
D-Fend Reloaded data directory) the line "AllowMultiFloppyImagesMount=1".

D-Fend Reloaded can also manage PhysFS drives. Set "AllowPhysFSUsage=1" in
the [ProgramSets] section of the "DFend.ini" and the mount edit dialog
will have a new "Folder and zip file as hard disk" sheet. But you cannot select
a program file or a setup file within a zip file to be run by D-Fend Reloaded.
If you want to run a file from a PhysFS drive, you have to leave the
"Program file" field blank and enter the run command in the autoexec section.

The ability to set the lines in text mode from 25 to 28 or 50 can be activated
the same way by writing "AllowTextModeLineChange=1" in the [ProgramSets]
section of the "DFend.ini".

All other special functions of the custom builds are not supported directly at
the moment. But you can tell D-Fend Reloaded to write custom strings in the
DOSBox conf file: All you have to do is writing the lines you want to have
in the conf file in the "Custom settings" edit field in the "DOSBox settings"
category (or in the edit field in the "Custom settings" sheet if you use the
classic profile editor).



5.) I want to use a different mp3 and ogg encoders than lame and oggenc2. Can
    I change the command line D-Fend Reloaded uses to call the encoders ?
	
Yes. Just setup the encoder file names in the setup dialog, close D-Fend
Reloaded, open the DFend.ini (which can be found in the D-Fend Reloaded data
directory) and add / customize this two lines in the [ProgramSets] section:
WaveEncMp3Parameters=-h -V 0 "%s" "%s"
WaveEncOggParameters="%s" --output="%s" --quality=10
The first %s stands for the input wave file (including full path) and the
second will be replaced by the output file (including full path).



6.) I have setup "C:\Users\me\D-Fend Reloaded\VritualHD" as drive C but DOSBox
    says it has mounted "C:\Users\me\D-FEND~1\VIRTUA~1". What's wrong ?

"C:\Users\me\D-FEND~1\VIRTUA~1" is the short name for "C:\Users\me\D-Fend
Reloaded\VritualHD". D-Fend Reloaded translates the long name to the short name
when building the DOSBox configuration file. The Cause is DOSBox can only handle
134 chars per command. So if the path is too long DOSBox perhaps will not mount
it. To avoid this, D-Fend Reloaded changes the path name to the short version.
For this it uses the Windows API function, this means there can't be any
mismatch between the way Windows makes shorts path names and D-Fend Reloaded
does. If you want to turn this off anyway, you can write to line
"UseShortFolderNames=0" in the [ProgramSets] section of the "DFend.ini".



7.) How can I create an other language for D-Fend Reloaded ?

Just choose the menu item "Translate the program to your language" from the
"Help making D-Fend Reloaded" better sub menu of the "Help" menu. Then choose
"Start new language" and enter the name of the new language.

D-Fend Reloaded will then create a new language file and open it in the
build-in language editor. The language editor shows tables for the different
categories (menu, profile editor, setup dialog) with the English texts on
the left side and (editable) your translations on the right side. All you
have to do is make translations of the shown English strings. After closing
the language editor you can activate your language from the setup dialog (its
handled just like the predefined languages).

If you want to have your language in the next official D-Fend Reloaded release
just mail the language file to me. (You can find the user defined language
files in the folder "C:\Users\me\D-Fend Reloaded\Lang".) And of course you will
get mentioned in the language files section of the program info dialog.
Therefor you should attend one thing: Your name and the name of the language
file are shown in any D-Fend Reloaded installation so make sure this two
strings appear right under any chosen codepage/charset. (This means for
example Cyrillic letters which are not defined in the English charset should
not be used in the language name and in the author name.)



8.) Is there an easy way of spell checking my new language file ?

Word processors usualy have quite good spell checkers but if you copy the whole
language file to a word processor you will get a lot of false error messages
because the word processor also trys to correct the "CouldNotDeleteFile=" parts
of the records. To avoid this you can use the following trick: Open the Windows
Notepad, press the tab key, mark the inserted tabulator (8 fields of space)
and copy it to the clipboard. Open the language file, open the replace dialog
in notepad, write in the "search for" field "=" and paste in the tab in the
"replace by" field. (This means replace all "=" by tabs.) Mark the whole file
and copy it in an spread sheet. Mark the second column (only the values
without the "CouldNotDeleteFile=" keys) and copy them to the word processor.
