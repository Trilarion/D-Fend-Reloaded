	The version of the source code and binary files is the date
	and time in the .ZIP file (1:00 == v1.00)

	The date format is (Norwegian) dd.mm.yyyy

	The .ZIP files are DZBIN???.ZIP - Program files
			   DZSRC???.ZIP - Source code


Memory Requirements
===================

	Doszip Commander needs at least 200K conventional memory in order
	to run all its internal viewers.

	The [Panel Filter] of each panel controles the global memory usage
	in the [Read count] section. The default count is 3000.

	The Doszip Commander comes with two additional memory configurations
	that can be selected from the command line. Each memory configuration
	limits the number of files that can be stored in each Commander File
	Panel. The command line syntax of these memory configurations are:


Command Line
============

	Command		Description
	-------		--------------------------------------------
	/T		Launch Commander with TINY memory
			configuration. Number of files per panel
			is 500.

	/L		Launch Commander with  LARGE memory
			configuration. Number of files per panel
			is 5000.

	/XP (WinXP)	Trigger a mode change on startup.

	/V (verbose) 	Print DOS return code (errorlevel).

	/C#		Set Configuration PATH to #
			This is the path on your hard disk where the
			Commander's files are stored (.CFG and .INI).

	  DZ <filename> command starts DZ and forces it to show <filename>
	contents if it is an archive or show folder contents if <filename>
	is a folder.


Compressed File Support
=======================

	Password protected Compressed files
	-----------------------------------
	While the Doszip Commander Compression Engine is compatible with
	PKZIP 1.x and PKZIP 2.x compress file formats, Commander only
	allows a single password for each compressed file to be active.

	Compression configuration
	-------------------------
	The compression utility is defined under the section [Packer], and
	must supports the concept of a response file. This file is created
	in the TEMP directory, and past on as argument to the utility.
	In PKZIP the @ character must precede the response filename. The
	command given to add a file is then: PKZIP -u -wHS @%TEMP%\ziplist

	The format of a compression utility is as follows: [00..15]

	[Packer]
	00=<Extension_of_archive>
	01=...

	This text is displayed on the Method Selection Dialog box.

	The format of the definition is as follows: [00..19]
	[00..09] - If current panel use Short File Names
	[10..19] - If current panel use Long File Names

	[<Extension_of_archive>]
	00=<command_0>
	01=<command_1>
	02=...

	The meaning of the numbers:

	0: Command to add a file to a compressed file.
	1: - and also store the file's full pathname.
	2: Command to extract a file from a compressed file.
	3: - and maintain it's full pathname.
	4: Command to delete a file from a compressed file.
	5: Command to create the smallest compressed file.
	6: Command to create a compressed file in the fastest possible time.
	7: Character that must precede the password.
	8: Character that must precede the target directory.
	9: Character that must precede the response filename.


Viewer Support
==============

	Internal Viewer
	---------------
	To launch the internal viewer contained within DZMAIN.EXE,
	type F3 (= Macro %VIEW%).

	Defining Viewers
	----------------
	All viewers are defined in the file DZ.INI.
	You can modify the [View] section of DZ.INI file
	to associated 4 viewers:

	[View]
	F3    = ; You can override the internal viewer by redefine F3
	Alt   = ; Viewer for Alt+F3
	Ctrl  = ; Viewer for Ctrl+F3
	Shift = ; Viewer for Shift+F3


Editor Support
==============

	Defining Editor
	---------------
	All editors are defined in the file DZ.INI.
	You can modify the [Edit] section of DZ.INI file
	to associated 4 editors:

	[Edit]
	F4	= ; Editor for F4 (= Macro %EDIT%)
	Alt   	= ; Editor for Alt+F4
	Ctrl  	= ; Editor for Ctrl+F4
	Shift 	= ; Editor for Shift+F4


Extension and Filename Support
==============================

	Defining Filetypes
	------------------
	You can modify the [Filetype] section to associated files in
	the format as follows:

	<ext>  = <command> !.! - filetype
	<name> = <command>     - filename (no ext)

	Multiple commands are parsed to a batch file:
	- use the ", " to separate the commands.

	Example: README.TXT

	[Filetype]
	TXT=echo !, echo .!, echo !.!

	Expands to a batch file:

	@echo off
	echo README
	echo .TXT
	echo README.TXT

	The macro !.! expand as follows:

	.INI entry	Filename	Output
	---------------------------------------------
	mak=make -f!	foo.mak:  	make -ffoo
	makefile=make   makefile: 	make makefile
	ext=echo .! !!	foo.ext:  	echo .ext !
	ext=echo 	foo.ext:  	echo foo.ext
	foo=echo !.!	foo:  		echo foo


Doszip Commander Environment Variables
======================================

	Doszip searches your environment for the following
	environment variables: COMSPEC, PATH, TEMP and DZ.

	Using the Commander with a RAM disk presents a special
	problem: if you save the setup, or if you change the menu
	file, these changes will be made to the files on the RAM
	disk. Which means you'll loose your changes as soon as you
	reboot or turn off your computer.

	The Commander provides two solutions to this problem.

	<> You can put a line into your autoexec.bat file that
	tells the Commander where to find these files, as well
	as other file's it needs that you haven't copied to the
	RAM disk. Put the following line into your autoexec.bat
	file:

	SET DZ=C:\DOSZIP

	'DZ' is the path on your hard disk where the Commander's
	files are stored.

	<> You can use the /C switch on the command line:

	DZ /CC:\DOSZIP


Windows 95/98/XP Compatibility
==============================

	Doszip uses the 'Windows95 LONG FILENAME' functions if avalible.

	Doszip uses the 'WINOLDAP' functions if avalible. This enables
	clipboard functions to Copy and Paste text from Windows.

	To use graphical colors in XP demands a mode-change in order to
	set the colors. This is Not done by the program. The -xp switch
	on the command line will trigger this mode-change on startup.


Installing Commander under Windows
==================================

	Right click your desktop, select New->Shortcut.
	Type in the full path name of the DZ.EXE file, e.g. C:\DOSZIP\DZ.EXE,
	or use the browse button if you are not sure of the path.

	Select the OK button.

	Select the Change Icon button.
	Type in the full path name of the DZ.ICO file, e.g. C:\DOSZIP\DZ.ICO,
	or use the browse button if you are not sure of the path.

	Select the OK button.

	The Doszip Commander is now installed on your desktop.


Creating a tools menu
=====================

	It is possible to add a user defined Tools Menu to
	the Doszip Commander's main menu.

	All Tool-items are defined in the file DZ.INI.
	You can modify the [Tools] section of DZ.INI
	to associated 20 Tool-items: [00..19]

	To define a Menu item use the following format:

	XX = <> ; Insert a line
	XX = Menu_Item_Name, Command_to_be_invoked_when_selected
	XX = Menu_Item_Name, [Menu_to_be_invoked_when_selected]

	Macros that can be used in 'Command' expand as follows:

	%EDIT%		[Edit] --> F4=<> | (null)
	%VIEW%		[View] --> F3=<> | Internal viewer
	%FIND%          Internal File Search(command)

	These must be the first command on the line. The macro
	%DOSZIP% may appear any place in the command line, and
	expand to the directory where the commander is located.

	You can insert commands into a sub-menu in the same way
	described above.

	For example a simple Tools Menu may look like:
	----------------------------------------------

	[Tools]
	00 = &Add tool,			%EDIT% %DOSZIP%\DZ.INI
	01 = <>
	02 = &Doszip directory,  	[Doszip]

	[Doszip]
	00 = Doszip &Command Line,      %DOSZIP%\DZ.EXE -?
	01 = View &DZ.INI,              %VIEW% %DOSZIP%\DZ.INI
	02 = View &README.TXT,          %VIEW% %DOSZIP%\README.TXT
	03 = Search &Source Directory,  %FIND% %DOSZIP%\src\*.*
	04 = Search &Include Directory, %FIND% %DOSZIP%\inc\*.*
	05 = <>
	06 = &Previous Menu.., 		[Tools]
