MainInfo=Information about the D-Fend Reloaded file structure
MainInfoPart1=D-Fend Reloaded is 100% Vista compatible. This means it respects the division of the program data into program files and user data. If you have installed D-Fend Reloaded in "user profile mode", the program files are located in the program files folder ("C:\Program files\D-Fend Reloaded" by default) and the user data files are located in a subfolder of the user profile directory ("C:\Users\<you>\D-Fend Reloaded" by default). When D-Fend Reloaded is running it will not write to the program folder anymore. All setup data is stored in the user profile subfolder.
MainInfoPart2=DOSBox and Windows do not use the same directory structures. The programs inside DOSBox only see a subset of the whole Windows directory structure. This implies that the games running in DOSBox cannot damage your system files (unless you setup DOSBox to use your real "C:\" as drive C: in DOSBox). In most cases you want to mount a folder like "C:\OldGames" as drive C: in DOSBox. This means that, if you store a game in "C:\OldGames\Somegame", you can access this game in DOSBox via "C:\Somegame", but you do not need to worry about mounting drives at all because D-Fend Reloaded is mounting the right folders automatically for you.
MainInfoPart3=You can store your game wherever you want, but it is recommended to use the predefined games directory ("C:\Users\<you>\D-Fend Reloaded\VirtualHD"). If you use this directory for your games, D-Fend Reloaded can use relative paths in the profile (".\VirtualHD\NewGame" instead of "C:\Users\<you>\D-Fend Reloaded\VirtualHD\NewGame"). If D-Fend Reloaded knows where the games' files are located relative to the program data directory, it can transfer the games' files to another installation or it can make installer packages for you. This isn't possible with absolute pathes.
Page1Info=Please choose the type of profile you want to create.
Page2Info=Please setup where the game or program file you want to start is located. If you choose a subfolder of the given directory for the files, D-Fend Reloaded will be able to use relative paths.
Page2InfoWindows=Please setup where the game or program file you want to start is located.
Page3Info=Please select a template for the new profile.
Page4Info=Please define the meta information for the new game or program. All  information is optional and can be completed using the profile editor at any time. This means there is no need to fill out all of these fields now, but it is recommended to at least choose a name for the profile.
Page5Info=Please check whether the drive mountings created by D-Fend Reloaded are correct and then start the profile creation process by clicking on "Ok".

GamesFolder.Info=You can place the games you want to use with D-Fend Reloaded in any directory, but if you put them in a subdirectory of %s D-Fend Reloaded will be able to store the paths as relative paths. Only with relative paths you can use the "Build installer" and "Transfer games" functions from the "Extras" menu.
BaseDataFolder.Info=You can place the games' data files (manuals etc.) in any directory. But if you put them in a subdirectory of %s D-Fend Reloaded will be able to store the paths as relative paths. Only with relative paths you can use the "Build installer" and "Transfer games" functions from the "Extras" menu.

BaseDataFolder=Recommended parent directory for the additional data directory
DataFolder=Additional data folder (optional)
DataFolder.Button=Setup additional files manually
DataFolder.Checkbox=Setup additional files directory automatically
DataFolder.AutomaticButton=Choose data folder name from profile name automatically
TemplateInfo=The auto setup templates are a special type of templates. Each auto setup template was created for one special game. D-Fend Reloaded tries to find a matching auto setup template for the given game or program file. Therefore it compares a checksum calculated over the real file with the checksums stored in the auto setup templates and compares the real filename with the filenames stored in the auto setup templates.[13][13]If the checksums match for with a particular auto setup template, you should use this template for the new profile because this auto setup template was made exactly for your game or program. You should only use a template that only matches by filename if there is no template that matches by checksum.[13][13]If there is an auto setup template for your game or program, but D-Fend Reloaded does not show it in the first two dropdown boxes, then you may have another unrecognized version of the program.[13][13]Alternatively you may use one of the normal templates for the new profile at any time, but if you use a normal template there is no guarantee the game or program will run immediately without any further setup.
TemplateType1=Use compatible auto setup template (recommended)
TemplateType1Info=These templates are made specifically for the selected game. They match with the program file via a checksum comparison.
TemplateType2=Use auto setup template that only matches by filename
TemplateType2Info=These templates match to the given program file by the filename but not by the checksum. May be your game version just differs from the game version the auto setup template was made from.
TemplateType3=Use user-defined auto setup template
TemplateType3Info=In this list you can find all available auto setup templates. If you are sure your new game is in this list, you can choose the corresponding auto setup template.
TemplateType4=Use user-defined template

DFend=D-Fend Reloaded is a complete rewrite of the discontinued good old D-Fend.[13][13]D-Fend (http://members.home.nl/mabus/) was once one of the best DOSBox frondends and I was very sad to see its development was stopped.[13][13]On the other hand: If the development of D-Fend had not stopped, D-Fend Reloaded would have never been written.
