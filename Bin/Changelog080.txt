- Option to run some other program (for example a hardware setup tool) before
  and after the main program (DOSBox or ScummVM).
- The genre and language names in game profiles can now be translated on the
  fly so profiles created via auto setup templates etc. will always be shown

  (thank you to skatz).

  profile is started and restored when the program quits (both optional).
- You can define a default keyboard layout and a default codepage per DOSBox
  installation now.
- On the first page of the of the wizard now you can choose how many things the

- Updated DOSZip from 1.28 to 1.31.
- Moved most program files to a "Bin" subfolder of the installation directory
  and moved all configuration files to a "Settings" subfolder of the 
  installation data directory. (This will make the usage of portable
  installations easier because less files in the main program main directory
  will make finding the DFend.exe faster.)
- Now also icons inside program dialogs can be replaced via the Icons.ini file.

  and zip file pair.
- You can make zip packages from installed games (just like the exe installers)
  for long time archiving your games. The zip archive will contain all game

  using notepad.
- Some more speed improvements when working with large profile lists.

  info dialog.


Version 0.4.0 (05/14/2008)

  database) can be setup by only entering the game name and the filename.
- ScummVM based advantures can be configurated and listed together with the
  DOSBox based profiles now.
- If you define a QBasic interpreter in the setup dialog, you can define bas

  key mapper file is defined, the DOSBox default key mapper file will be used.)

  be defined now (some kind of complement of the Autoexec.bat commands).
- Now you can also make installer packages from your profile templates.
- The templates dialog now has an option to change multiple templates at once
  (like the multi profile editor for normal profile).
- More option to configurate low-level access to mounted CDROMs.

  configuration) in the destination folder before copying the profile data.
- Now you can define if the path to the game and the setup exe file should be
  interpreted absolute (in the physical file system) or relative (to the file
  system in DOSBox).
- Now you can configurate in the setup dialog if D-Fend Reloaded should show
  configuration options in the profile editor which can only be used with
  DOSBox CVS builds (like multiple floppy images per drive, PhysFS support,
  setting the number of text mode lines, VGA chipset and video RAM, Glide
  emulation and printer support).
- When changeing multiple profiles, creating installers etc. now you can select
  and unselect profiles also by any user defined information. (Until now
  selecting was only possible by the predefined fields like language,
  developer, year, etc.)
- Profiles (conf and prof files), screenshots and captured sound can be
  imported by drag&drop now. Dragging program files to the D-Fend Reloaded
  program window will open the new profile wizard with the chosen file.
- Within the multi profile editor you can add, change and delete user-defined
  information fields now.
- For each profile you can define some extra files which will be transfered,
  uninstalled and packed into installer packages together with the other game
  files (like it is already possible with the extra directories).
- The profile editor will show a warning if the user trys to create a new
  profile with no game program filename (and is not using a boot image option).
- When opening the select game exe or select setup exe dialog from the profile
  editor or the wizard the path of the setup exe or the game exe (if already
  defined) will be used as initial directory instead of the games base
  directory.
- When a checksum error (changed or exchanged game program file) is detected,
  D-Fend Reloaded now also offers the option to turn off checksums for the
  profile (until now only keep old checksum or create new checksum).

  dialog now.

  to any position in the file via a slider and the captured wave sound can be
  encoded to mp3 or ogg directly from the dialog now.
- The screenshot view dialog has been improved: You can cycle though the
  screenshots of a profile via two new toolbar buttons (or by using the cursor
  keys or the mouse wheel) without closing the dialog. Additionally the zoom
  level is set to 100% when a new image is loaded.  
- The import conf file function now trys to make mount records from the mount
  commands of the autoexec section.
- Now you can setup which icons should be visible on the toolbar.
- The tooltips in the games list now also show the last modification time of
  each profile.
- Some new icons in the modern and classic profile editor (thanks to Banjo).
- [Fix] Even if you choose "Restore profile on disk with version from memory"
  when a file conflict occures the profile on disk will not be changed and
  the version in memory will be lost as long as you do not make any changes to
  the profile in memory before closing D-Fend Reloaded.
- [Fix] The boot from floppy image function did not work if you used a single
  image file.

  installation mode) the templates were only created for the user account the
  installer was run from.

   "." in the new filename were removed.

- [Fix] User defined fields were ignored when exporting a games list.

  minimized" the application is minimized to the taskbar instead of the tray
  area on programm start-up.

  developer, etc.) of the new profile always showed "Not set" until restart of
  the program.

- All available CDs can automatically be mounted at DOSBox start (optional,
  configurateable per profile).

  really needed. (This makes using multiple instances of D-Fend Reloaded at the
  same time easier.)
- A warning message will appear if you try to run a game from a profile made
  for some other game. (With each profile checksums for the game and the setup
  exe will be stored automatically compared with the real exe when trying to
  run the game.)
- A warning message will appear if you try to run a program file which is not
  reachable via any mounted folder.
- The function that builds the autoexec commands to run the game now also looks
  on mounted CDs for a path to the file and when there are overlapping mounts
  it will use the shortest path instead of the first matching path.

  (until now screenshot capture folder was only setup automatically when adding
  profiles via the wizard). This feature can be turned off in the setup dialog.

  default values.

  editor table may changes the the list of environment variables in unexpected
  ways.
- [Fix] When browsing for a installation directory in the program installer and
