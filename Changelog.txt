Version 0.4.0 (05/14/2008)
==========================
- Simplified Chinese language file (thanks to muzuiget)
- The new profile wizard has been completely redesigned. With the new auto
  setup templates new profiles (for games known by the D-Fend Reloaded
  database) can be setup by only entering the game name and the filename.
- ScummVM based advantures can be configurated and listed together with the
  DOSBox based profiles now.
- If you define a QBasic interpreter in the setup dialog, you can define bas
  files as normal program files for games. When executing a bas file profile
  D-Fend Reloaded will automatically execute it in QBasic in DOSBox.
- A new first run wizard makes setting up language and updates for new users
  much easier.
- The content of image files can be extracted to a folder now.
- You can build a floppy image from the content of a folder now.
- If you copy prof files to the "Confs" folder while D-Fend Reloaded is running
  they will be added to the games list immediately.
- Icons form outside the "IconLibrary" folder can now also be used as profile
  icons (and can be transfered with the profile and included to installers just
  like the icons in the default icons folder).
- If you delete a profile file while D-Fend Reloaded is running it will ask you
  if you want to restore the deleted file.
- Now you can setup a codepage to be used in DOSBox for each profile. 
  Additionally there is a default codepage stored in each language file which
  will be used if the codepage is set to "default" in the profile.
- Now you can (optionally) define a key mapper file for each profile. (If no
  key mapper file is defined, the DOSBox default key mapper file will be used.)
- A list of batch commands which DOSBox will run after the end of the game can
  be defined now (some kind of complement of the Autoexec.bat commands).
- Now you can also make installer packages from your profile templates.
- The templates dialog now has an option to change multiple templates at once
  (like the multi profile editor for normal profile).
- More option to configurate low-level access to mounted CDROMs.
- When creating floppy images you can choose to make the image bootable now.
- The tray icon has a context menu for direct starting and adding of profiles.
- The transfer profiles function can create a portable version of D-Fend
  Reloaded (by copying files from the current installation and modifing the
  configuration) in the destination folder before copying the profile data.
- Now you can define if the path to the game and the setup exe file should be
  interpreted absolute (in the physical file system) or relative (to the file
  system in DOSBox).
- Now you can configurate in the setup dialog if D-Fend Reloaded should show
  configuration options in the profile editor which can only be used with
  DOSBox CVS builds (like multiple floppy images per drive, PhysFS support,
  setting the number of text mode lines, VGA chipset and video RAM, Glide
  emulation and printer support).
- When changeing multiple profiles, creating installers etc. now you can select
  and unselect profiles also by any user defined information. (Until now
  selecting was only possible by the predefined fields like language,
  developer, year, etc.)
- Profiles (conf and prof files), screenshots and captured sound can be
  imported by drag&drop now. Dragging program files to the D-Fend Reloaded
  program window will open the new profile wizard with the chosen file.
- Within the multi profile editor you can add, change and delete user-defined
  information fields now.
- For each profile you can define some extra files which will be transfered,
  uninstalled and packed into installer packages together with the other game
  files (like it is already possible with the extra directories).
- The profile editor will show a warning if the user trys to create a new
  profile with no game program filename (and is not using a boot image option).
- When opening the select game exe or select setup exe dialog from the profile
  editor or the wizard the path of the setup exe or the game exe (if already
  defined) will be used as initial directory instead of the games base
  directory.
- When a checksum error (changed or exchanged game program file) is detected,
  D-Fend Reloaded now also offers the option to turn off checksums for the
  profile (until now only keep old checksum or create new checksum).
- The checksum driven game file change detection can be turned off in the setup
  dialog now.
- The mount dialog will show a warning if the users trys to use the same drive
  letter for two mounted drives.
- The mount dialog will show a warning message if the users trys to mount the
  the root directory of a drive.
- The dialog for playing captured game sounds has been improved: You can jump
  to any position in the file via a slider and the captured wave sound can be
  encoded to mp3 or ogg directly from the dialog now.
- The screenshot view dialog has been improved: You can cycle though the
  screenshots of a profile via two new toolbar buttons (or by using the cursor
  keys or the mouse wheel) without closing the dialog. Additionally the zoom
  level is set to 100% when a new image is loaded.
- The import conf file function now trys to make mount records from the mount
  commands of the autoexec section.
- Now you can setup which icons should be visible on the toolbar.
- The tooltips in the games list now also show the last modification time of
  each profile.
- Some new icons in the modern and classic profile editor (thanks to Banjo).
- [Fix] Even if you choose "Restore profile on disk with version from memory"
  when a file conflict occures the profile on disk will not be changed and
  the version in memory will be lost as long as you do not make any changes to
  the profile in memory before closing D-Fend Reloaded.
- [Fix] The boot from floppy image function did not work if you used a single
  image file.
- [Fix] When using D-Fend Reloaded in portable mode the path to the DOSBox
  language file was not updated properly what could DOSBox prevent from
